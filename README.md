FDR-based categorical variables selection in Naive Bayes classification

abstract: Naïve Bayes classification is based on the naïve Bayes assumption that explanatory variables are conditionally independent given the response variable. Although the naïve Bayes assumption is rather strong, the naïve Bayes classifier shows reasonable performances and has computational advantages on high-dimensional data. Since high-dimensional data sets usually have many noisy variables, variable selection can improve the accuracy in prediction and the interpretation of the classifier. In this paper, we propose a categorical variable selection method based on FDR control in naïve Bayes classification. Through simulations and real data analysis, the proposed method is compared with another variable selection method based on change point analysis and the proposed methods is illustrated to be more effective, particularly, for sparse or high-dimensional data.
